# Electrochemistry-Tools
This repository contains tools for calculating or converting conditions and measurements in molten salt electrochemistry experiments

####RE_Converter_AgCl_vs_Cl.xlsx
This file uses data from the literature to compare and convert between the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the Cl-/Cl2 reference electrode

####Eutectic_LiCl-KCl_Calculator.xlsx
This file can be used to determine the amount of each salt constituient to add to achieve a eutectic mixture of LiCl-KCl and to achieve a certain wt% of analyte(s) within the euctectic LiCl-KCl melt
